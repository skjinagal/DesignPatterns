Strategy Pattern

## Usage

this project is created to learn and understand Strategy Design pattern.
 - I have a duck super class which has some behaviors and the sub types inherits this super class to inherit those and behaviors and also override them
 - this is well and good but what happens if tomorrow, some new requirement comes, lets we want a fly behavior.
