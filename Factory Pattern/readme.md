# Factory Pattern

- The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which 
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

- Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

- our high-level components should not depend on our low-level components; rather, they should both depend on abstractions
