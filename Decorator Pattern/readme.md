# Decorator Pattern

- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

- think of decorator objects as “wrappers.”

- Decorators have the same supertype as the objects they decorate.

- The decorator adds its own behavior before and/or after delegating to the object it decorates to do the rest of the job.

- The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative  to subclassing for extending functionality.

- Decorators implement the same interface or abstract class as the component they are going to decorate.
